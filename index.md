# Portfolio

This portfolio contains the week by week reflections of how I am going on my Visual Condition Project. It contains my personal Professional and Technical proficiencies, as well as thoughts on how well I did. It documents my learning experiences with Unity. 

## Week: 1
### Monday Class:
In this first class of week 1, we were tasked to set up our own workstations. This was most likely used to simulate the real world. We had to pick a spot in the project room, then setup our computers in our workspace. After that, we learnt about how the Projects work, which projects were available, and when we had to decide what project we wished to do. I was interested in doing the SysOps project as that is a career that I am interested in, but I also was very interested in game development. I knew game development was a popular topic so I wary of how long I was wanting to take to decide.

### Thursday Class:
Before the second class, I had an interview with Adon about which project I wanted to do. I had decided I was going to put Game development as my main project, and SysOps as my backup incase Game dev was full.
During our Thursday class, the project teams were announced. I had been put into the Game Development project, however I had been split off into a subgroup due to the number of people wishing to do Game Dev. I was split into a group of 3 with Mitchell Briggs and Nick Mulrooney. For this Thursday class, we just got to know each other. We learnt about who was confident at what things and quite quickly got friendly.
