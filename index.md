# Portfolio

This portfolio contains the week by week reflections of how I am going on my Visual Condition Project. It contains my personal Professional and Technical proficiencies, as well as thoughts on how well I did. It documents my learning experiences with Unity. 

## Week: 1
### Monday Class:
In this first class of week 1, we were tasked to set up our own workstations. This was most likely used to simulate the real world. We had to pick a spot in the project room, then setup our computers in our workspace. After that, we learnt about how the Projects work, which projects were available, and when we had to decide what project we wished to do. I was interested in doing the SysOps project as that is a career that I am interested in, but I also was very interested in game development. I knew game development was a popular topic so I wary of how long I was wanting to take to decide.

### Thursday Class:
Before the second class, I had an interview with Adon about which project I wanted to do. I had decided I was going to put Game development as my main project, and SysOps as my backup incase Game dev was full.
During our Thursday class, the project teams were announced. I had been put into the Game Development project, however I had been split off into a subgroup due to the number of people wishing to do Game Dev. I was split into a group of 3 with Mitchell Briggs and Nick Mulrooney. For this Thursday class, we just got to know each other. We learnt about who was confident at what things and quite quickly got friendly.

### Reflection:

## Week: 2
### Monday Class:
On the Monday class, we got introduced to the software we would be using. It was game engine known as Unity. This class was primarily focused on getting Unity up and running, then learning how to use it. Our computer were not powerful enough to run some of the basic tutorials so I resorted to going onto Youtube and the Unity documentation to learn how to start development with Unity.

### Thursday Class:
On Thursday, I began practising making scenes in Unity. The group had decided to dedicate the next few classes to primarily learning the fundamentals of Unity, so they began to follow a tutorial of how to make a roll a ball game. I jumped in head first and just started developing a small map with interactable objects. I wanted to learn about physics and colliders. I learnt the differences between the different colliders and which colliders are better for certain situations.

## Week: 3
### Monday Class:
On the Monday class, I wanted to start focusing my attention towards the project, and what I was going to be making. At this point, I had not been assigned an actual project, I just knew that Adon was planning on doing something with Virtual Reality (VR) development on mobile devices. I began looking into how dofficult it is to create VR apps and learnt that it was relatively straight forward. I began by reading up on Google DayDream as I had been given a Google DayDream VR Headset to work with. I read the documentation on how to setup a scene in Unity and watched a few tutorials. Once I had a fair idea of what I was doing, I began creating a scene in which the player just stands infront of a ball and they are able to pick it up and move it around.

### Thursday Class:
On Thurday I got to class and continued work on my VR world. At this point I could pick the ball up and move it around, but once I released the ball, it remained exactly where it was. I decided to add gravity to it. (The code I used here ended up being used later on for the real project). During thi9s class, I learnt that I would be working with visual impairments. Straight away I thought about Colour Blindness. I research some colour blindness plugins and presents and found a perfect one. I quickly implemented it into my Ball scene. I now had a game which you could pick up a ball while simulating different colour blindnesses.
