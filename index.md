## Week: 1
### Monday Class:
In this first class of week 1, we were tasked to set up our own workstations. This was most likely used to simulate the real world. We had to pick a spot in the project room, then setup our computers in our workspace. After that, we learnt about how the Projects work, which projects were available, and when we had to decide what project we wished to do. I was interested in doing the SysOps project as that is a career that I am interested in, but I also was very interested in game development. I knew game development was a popular topic so I wary of how long I was wanting to take to decide.
